<span style="color:'gray'">**BOOM-BOX**</span> is a **Music Recommendation** web application built with **HTML**, **CSS** and **React**.
<br>

The project was built with the motive of understanding various functionalities of **React** including the usage of objects in React.
<br>

 **React** is essentially a javascript library for building **User Interfaces**. However using **React** makes the considerably less tedious. While using **React** we just need to design the views for each state in our web application and **React** will efficiently update and render just the right components when the data changes.

## <span style="font-size:2rem">**Project Detail**</span>
**Boom-Box** is a **Movie Recommendation** web application which recommends music to the users based on their taste.
<br>
Originally the application provides the users to browse from the available categories i.e by **Genres** or **Artist**. Proceeding further, the user can choose from various options available based on the **previous input**. Based on user's choice all the available music albums are suggested which users can listen on **Spotify**.

To handle the state of the input flag, we used **React's Hook API** [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html).
<br>
To implement the **DOM** functionalities [React DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) is used.
